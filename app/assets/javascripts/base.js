/**
 * NOTE: This approach is a mixture of Self-Executing Anonymous Function and Revealing Module Pattern.
 * 		 Parameters below are explained as follows;
 * 		 1) Any reference to Base will equate to window.Base. 
 * 			If it is already defined, the existing definition will be used.
 * 			Thereby allowing our definitions to be appended to the existing one.
 * 			If it is not defined yet, all we get is {} 
 * 			(look at 'window.Base = window.Base || {}' on bottom of script).
 * 			So in any case, our definitions will be available in any reference of Base. 
 *  	 2) Make sure any reference to $ within this script refers to jQuery. 
 *  		This is because it is possible that $ refers to other libraries as well, 
 *  		i.e. calling jQuery.noConflict() while using script.aculo.us
 *  	 3) Make sure undefined uses it's default value, which is undefined. 
 *  		This is because undefined can be "redefined" to another value.
 *  		Since our first line of code has 3 arguments, and the bottom line 
 *  		only has two, the third argument, which is undefined, will evaluate
 *  		to undefined. Therefore, any reference to undefined within our script
 *  		will not produce any unexpected results.
